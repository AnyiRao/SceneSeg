## ThresholdDetector Class Implementation

    Detects both fast cuts and slow fades so long as an appropriate threshold
    is chosen (especially taking into account the minimum grey/black level).

    Attributes:
        threshold:  8-bit intensity value that each pixel value (R, G, and B)
            must be <= to in order to trigger a fade in/out.
        min_percent:  Float between 0.0 and 1.0 which represents the minimum
            percent of pixels in a frame that must meet the threshold value in
            order to trigger a fade in/out.
        min_shot_len:  Unsigned integer greater than 0 representing the
            minimum length, in frames, of a shot (or subsequent shot cut).
        fade_bias:  Float between -1.0 and +1.0 representing the percentage of
            timecode skew for the start of a shot (-1.0 causing a cut at the
            fade-to-black, 0.0 in the middle, and +1.0 causing the cut to be
            right at the position where the threshold is passed).
        add_final_shot:  Boolean indicating if the video ends on a fade-out to
            generate an additional shot at this timecode.
        block_size:  Number of rows in the image to sum per iteration (can be
            tuned to increase performance in some cases; should be computed
            programmatically in the future).
