    """Detects motion events in shots containing a static background.

    Uses background subtraction followed by noise removal (via morphological
    opening) to generate a frame score compared against the set threshold.

    Attributes:
        threshold:  floating point value compared to each frame's score, which
            represents average intensity change per pixel (lower values are
            more sensitive to motion changes).  Default 0.5, must be > 0.0.
        num_frames_post_shot:  Number of frames to include in each motion
            event after the frame score falls below the threshold, adding any
            subsequent motion events to the same shot.
        kernel_size:  Size of morphological opening kernel for noise removal.
            Setting to -1 (default) will auto-compute based on video resolution
            (typically 3 for SD, 5-7 for HD). Must be an odd integer > 1.
