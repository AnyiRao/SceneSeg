> Codebase for CVPR2020 A Local-to-Global Approach to Multi-modal Movie Scene Segmentation

![demo image](images/pipeline.png)

## Introduction
From a video to segemented scenes. Basically, two steps are needed including holistic features extraction and temporal scene segmentation.

A single stage temporal scene segmentation is also provided in the [demo](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#demo). This is going to be a easy-to-use tool for plot/story unstanding with scene as a semantic unit.
Currently, it only supports image input.

ðŸ˜¬The scene segmentation dataset is prompted to **MMMovie** project with 318 movies together with a easy-to-use toolkit. It is encouraged to use in the future. 

## Features
- Basic video processing tools are provided including shot detection and its parallel version.
- Holistic semantic video feature extractors including place, audio, human, action, speech are planned to be included if you wish and leave a looking forward message in the issue. Place and audio are supported now in the ``pre``.
- All-in-one scene segmentation tool with all multi-modal multi-semantic elements.

## Notice 
ðŸ˜…Since some enthusiastic researchers are requesting the codes but we are still working on organizing the codebase in an easy-to-use fashion, e.g. **MMMovie**, we release a on-going version here.
Some features are to be updated e.g. the feature extraction of human, action, speech and some common movie preprocessing tools.

## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation and dataset preparation. Pretrained model are here

## Get Started
ðŸ¥³Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the basic usage.
